# Exploratory Data Analysis on the Pokemon Dataset

This repository contains the code and documentation for my exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Pokemon dataset. The analysis was performed on the dataset available on Kaggle, which can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alopez247/pokemon).

## Overview

In this project, I conducted an exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the Pokemon dataset. The primary objectives of this analysis were:

- Understanding the dataset's structure and contents.
- Exploring statistical summaries and visualizations to uncover patterns and trends.
- Drawing meaningful conclusions about the Pokemon world and its creatures.

## Kaggle Kernel

I have documented my analysis and code on Kaggle. You can view the Kaggle Kernel [here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/suryanshmehrotra/pokemon-descriptive-analysis). The Kernel includes:

- Python code using libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
- Data cleaning and preprocessing steps.
- Visualization of key statistics and insights.
- Interactive visualizations for deeper exploration.

## Dataset Description

The dataset used for this analysis contains information about various Pokemon, including attributes such as name, type, abilities, and base stats. It provides a comprehensive view of the Pokemon world, making it a valuable resource for fans and researchers alike.

## Usage

You can use the Kaggle Kernel as a guide to replicate the analysis or explore the dataset further. The code and visualizations presented in the Kernel can be a valuable resource for anyone interested in Pokemon or data analysis.

## Feedback and Contributions

Feedback and contributions are welcome! If you have any suggestions, found errors, or want to contribute additional analyses, please feel free to open an issue or create a pull request.

Happy exploring the world of Pokemon!
